      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>
        After reading the requirements, I interpreted and structured them below
        for my own reference.
      </p>
      <h2>Create an "available inventory" modal component.</h2>
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Validate the email field client-side. Represent the validation state
            using a green or red border.
          </p>
          <aside>
            <p>
              I can validate the state using either a regex or a function that
              parses the field. Either way, the more stringent validation will
              occur on the server. I can likely find a 99% solution via google.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Respond to submission with either an error or success state.
          </p>
          <aside>
            <p>
              This is the only requirement that has deeper technical
              implications, and thus should be given some consideration.
            </p>
            <p>
              The consideration here is how to handle asynchronicity within a
              component. My initial thought is to use a promise and resolve it
              when the API call completes. Another approach is to manage the
              state of the request outside the component.
            </p>
            <p>
              There should be a timeout feature to handle the case where the
              user loses internet connectivity or simply has too much
              latency. There may be a standard value backed by research for this
              number. The duration should account for the fact that internet
              speeds can vary significantly.
            </p>
            <p>
              UX-wise, the validation message can present itself either during
              typing or after the user attempts to submit the form.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's usually better to show the error post-submit, as the form
              will be in some error state when presented with an initially
              partial email. This is jarring. It gives the wrong impression
              where the user is progressing normally.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prevent multiple form submissions.
          </p>
          <aside>
            <p>
              This will require some state to track an existing submission.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Present a loading indicator during submission.
          </p>
          <aside></aside>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When the modal is closed, the form is reset.
          </p>
          <aside>
            <p>
              My initial thought is that this will take care of itself. When a
              React component is "unmounted," its state is loss. I don't foresee
              any additional work needed to handle this requirement.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            On form submission, output the product variant ID and the email
            address to the browser console.
          </p>
          <aside>
            <p>
              I understand this is a placeholder for a real API call. I will
              model the call as if it were making a real async request. That
              way, in actual usage, only the implementation would need to be
              changed.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Constraints</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Limit dependencies to core React.
        </li>
        <li>
          No component libraries.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-top: 40px;">
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        Some things were not fully implemented due to time constraints.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete visual states for UX components (hover, focus states).</li>
        <li>Visual transitions (fading, translating).</li>
        <li>Responsive, mobile design. The modal should fill the entire page on a narrow screen.</li>
        <li>Overriding default styles (heavy black border on focused input elements).</li>
      </ul>
